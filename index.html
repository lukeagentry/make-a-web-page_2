    <h3>HTML and The Internet</h3>
 </div>
 <div class="text">
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  The web contains somewhere around 30 billion HTML documents.  These documents are all stored on servers. When you <a href="https://www.google.com">"Google"</a> something, your computer submits a <em>HTTP</em> request to a server.  The server finds the document you are looking for and sends that document to your computers browser. The browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer.</p>

    <p>All HTML documents are divided in to multiple "invisible boxes" of content.  These boxes can contain things such as images, text and even links to other pages.  When creating an idea for a website, it can be useful to take something as simple as a pencil to draw out the overall design of the website.  You can then take it one step further by drawing boxes around related content.  This will help give you an idea as to how the website would be built.  There are many ways to make these "invisible boxes".  One way it to use what is called a "div" tag.  You simply place a opening "div" tag at the begining of the content and a closing "div" tag at the end.</p>

  <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Tags and elements make up every page of HTML code. This is how computers read the documents.  Tags consist of two parts.  There is an opening tag and a closing tag.  To create the opening tag you use the less than sign, put your command inside, and place a greater than symbol on the other side.  You then place your content inside and close the tag by using the less than sign, backslash, your command, and the greater than sign.  So, to make something bold you would write &lt;b&gt; Content &lt;/b&gt;.  Everything from the begining less than symbol to the ending greater than symbol make up an element.  </p>

      <h3> Computers are Stupid </h3>
</div>
    <div class=text>
      <p>Computers are stupid in that they can't catch basic coding mistakes that a human can catch. They simply do what they are told to do by the coding within the HTML document. Therefore, having a period out of place or forgetting to close a tag can cause major problems.  This is why you must be so precise with all coding.</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3></div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Elements of an HTML document are either Inline or Block.  Block elements are used to create "invisible boxes" around the content inside of them.  Two examples of block elements &lt;div&gt; and &lt;p&gt;.  Inline elements generally only apply to the content in between the opening and closing of the tag.  Two examples of inline elements would be &lt;em&gt; and &lt;b&gt;.</p>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Google Chrome is a unique internet browser.  Whenever you open a internet page using Chrome, a menu appears in the upper right hand corner.  You can click on this menu and go to "tools".  From there you can go to "developer tools".  When you open developer tools on a webpage, you can see all of the HTML coding for that page.  This is a great tool when you are first starting to code.  By looking at existing code and changing the code, you can start to figure out how things are programed.</p>

<div class="topic" id="repetition">
  <h3> Avoiding Repetition </h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Avoiding repetition in HTML coding is very important.  For instance, a programer that uses a lot of repetition will often write the exact same code over and over.  In many cases they will simply copy and paste code in to different parts of a document.  When that programer decides to make changes to a document, they have to go through every line of code ensure that small change was replicated.</p>
    <p>Consistency is another very good reason to avoid repetition when writing HTML code.  If you want to give a document or a series of documents the same feel, then they must be coded the same.  This is best done by assigning specific "classes" to each part of the document.  By having different "classes" for each part of the document, you only have to change the class file in your CSS to make changes throughout the entire document.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
</div> 
<div class="text">
    <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.  These style sheets are what is used to determing how a page looks on the internet.  You can control virtualy every aspect of a page if you know the correct CSS to use.  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">This page</a> can be used as a resource for looking up different CSS.  It would be almost impossible to learn every CSS variable, so it is common to use a website like this.</p>

    <h3>Checking HTML and CSS Code</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
      <p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">This page</a> can be used for checking the formatting of your HTML coding.  At the bottom of the page, all of the errors in your HTML file will be revealed.  Also,<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">This page </a> can be used to make sure that you CSS coding is correct.</p>
